                        <dd>Many Swedish furniture retailers feel threatened by the low prices of IKEA products. They put pressure on suppliers to boycott the IKEA brand. In the 1950s, they try to prevent Ingvar from exhibiting at or even visiting furniture fairs. But every challenge has a solution – this is one of the reasons we started to look for collaborations abroad.</dd>

                        <dd>High costs and damage rates when transporting furniture via mail order are a constant thorn in Ingvar’s side. Although flat-pack furniture already exists, it hasn’t really taken off in Sweden yet. It takes a demonstration by IKEA supplier Ovendals in Hultsfred of a very stable flat-pack table for this to change. Flat-pack, self-assembly products become the solution to the transportation struggle, and the rest is history.</dd>

                        <dd>In June 1960, only coffee and cold dishes are offered in IKEA stores. By the end of the year, the IKEA restaurant kitchen is fully equipped, including a microwave oven – a novelty at the time. Everything from hot snacks such as hamburgers to á la carte dishes are served. The idea comes from something Ingvar observes: people leave the store at lunchtime to eat in one of the restaurants or street kitchens in Älmhult. This interrupts the whole buying process. He realises that hungry customers buy less. Or as we often say, it’s tough to do business on an empty stomach.</dd>

It is also the beginning of something new. In the chaos following the fire, we open a self-service area, which turns out to be a roaring success. By the time the store re-opens in 1971, most products can be picked up in the self-service area, driven home and assembled by our customers.</dd>

By 1973, our products are sold in a sort of mini IKEA store called “IKEA Corner” through a joint-venture with a Japanese retailer. However, the IKEA franchise system is not yet developed, and cooperation difficulties lead to the end of the Japanese business in 1983. Happily, our second attempt 20 years later is successful, which just goes to show that good things happen if you try and try again.</dd>
