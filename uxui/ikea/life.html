                <p>We have a vision – to create a better life for as many people as possible. And we firmly believe a better life starts at home. But how can we stay in touch with what people actually need when the world around us is constantly changing? </p>

                <img src="img/life/1.jpg" alt="image">
                <p>For our relationship with home, 2020 has been like no other. All across the world, we’ve been confined within our four walls, leading many of us to come to a realisation: we want something different from our lives at home. With new priorities emerging everywhere and all at once, the way we will live in the future now looks dramatically different.</p>

                    <h4>The start of a <br> closer relationship with home</h4>
                    <p>This is the Big Home Reboot, and it marks a change to our relationship with home that’s being experienced across the globe. Because it’s happening not in one place or to one group, but to everyone, everywhere. While it’s felt differently by people of different ages, household sizes, incomes and nationalities – and not always for the better – globally, the vast majority of us feel closer to our homes than we did before the pandemic. Now, many of us are making plans to protect this newfound closeness – and the wellbeing it offers us – in our future lives at home. What kind of reboot does your relationship with your home need?</p>

                    <h4>The IKEA Life at Home Report</h4>
                    <img src="img/life/4.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>We believe home is the most important place in the world. That’s why for the last seven years we’ve studied how thousands of people around the world live at home – 2020 has been a year like no other. Having a safe place to call home matters – without it, we can’t thrive. The disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has been felt by everyone, everywhere, all at the same time, and hasn’t just challenged our homes like never before, but has rapidly changed our relationship with them. </p>

                    <h4>Studying the most important <br> place in the world</h4>
                    <p>As our world continues to change and challenge us, having a place to feel at home has never been more important. Data isn’t enough to understand what makes a good home, so we try to bring empathy and understanding into all our research. What we find helps us make business decisions that don’t just make sense for how people are living today, but challenge us to help everyone live better tomorrow. While everyone wants – and deserves – to thrive in their lives at home, we know that too many people struggle because their homes aren’t able to meet their needs. Through our Life at Home work, we’re on a mission to put this right.</p>
