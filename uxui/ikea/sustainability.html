            <div class="container-contents"></div>
            <p>We want to have a positive
            impact on people, society and the
            planet. For us, it’s about balancing
            economic growth and positive
            social impact with environmental
            protection and regeneration. We always think long term – to be able to meet
            the needs of people today without compromising
            the needs of future generations. Doing this requires rethinking and inspiring
            changes in lifestyles and consumption, and to
            adopt </p>
            <p>new ways of working. We are committed
            to leading the way forward together with our
            co-workers, customers and partners and to using
            our size to make a positive difference. This is both
            a responsibility and a business opportunity. The
            more people we reach, the bigger the impact we
            can have together, and the more people we can
            enable to live a better everyday life.</p>

            <div class="container-contents"></div>
            <p>The unbleached and untreated material from the plantation was brought to the Vietnamese weavers. Using as much bamboo as possible, together they created a pattern with a wider variation of natural colours. The use of raw material was bigger than ever – previous lamps used around 18% of the raw material, but KNIXHULT uses 65%. And it’s not only the reduced bamboo waste Anna and Emma are pleased about. The lamp shade is stackable so the transport doesn’t require so much space, and the use of plastic in the packaging is reduced. The whole lamp is also really easy to separate and recycle when it reaches the end of its life, and no metal or plastic is included except for what is in the lighting components. So did KNIXHULT become a sustainable icon? Perhaps only time will tell. And the team is already on a quest to find the next one.</p>

            <h3>Unsustainable consumption</h3>
            <div class="container-contents"></div>
            <p>In a world that already uses resources
            requiring more than one planet, billions of
            new consumers put an even greater pressure
            on the planet. In many parts of the world,
            consumption is growing at an unsustainable
            rate. And while many people are escaping
            poverty, many also lack access to affordable
            and healthy food. Today, it’s estimated that the world must
            produce 70% more food by 2050 due to
            population growth, but also due to trends in rising consumption of meat and </p>
            <p>dairy, and the current loss or wastage of one third of all food produced Resource scarcity and air, water and land pollution are very visible due, in part, to
            unsustainable consumption and wastefulness.
            For IKEA, unsustainable consumption is one of
            our biggest challenges: How can we continue
            to grow and enable more people to live better
            everyday lives within the boundaries of the
            planet?</p>

            <h3>Creating jobs with sisterhood and banana fibres</h3>
            
            <p>Behind the handmade collection BOTANISK are 5,600 talented women artisans. Ami Patel from Industree Foundation in India does not only see banana bark transformed into beautiful baskets, but also sisterhood and jobs being created. 
            The BOTANISK collection combines function and beauty with urban gardening and indoor potting in mind. The pots, plant hangers, tool bags, pillows and rugs are all made out of natural tactile materials like jute, better cotton and banana fibre. The collection is made in close collaboration with six social entrepreneurs, whose ideas are based on creating work in regions where it’s most needed. Each item is handmade by skilled artisans in India, Jordan, Thailand, and Romania.
            “We have tried to make sure that you can see that each item is handmade so that there is a clear link to the people who made it – almost like an autograph”, says IKEA designer Andreas Fredriksson.</p>

            <div class="container-contents"></div>
            <p>“The future is bright. Banana bark is a natural fibre and a material that would be wasted if we didn’t upcycle it. Thanks to the artisans’ skills, we create something beautiful and give it an entirely new value,”
                <br> <span style="font-weight: 300">- says Ami.</span></p>
